       I think badgers would cook a <em>really </em>good bowl of mac and cheese. They'd use different cheeses and seasonings and also bake it to get the top layer crunchy and the bottom layers gooey. A badger's mac and cheese is comforting, and could really cheer you up when you're feeling down.

        Considering that wolverines can just straight up chew through bone, they
      probably wouldn't even bother with cooking this. I think their mac and
      cheese would be al dente or just, like, raw. Raw uncooked macaroni and 
      an angrilly torn open packet of cheese dust on top of the macaroni.

    <p>Oh... oh no. Okay well, the effort was there but the execution just left a lot to be desired. I'm not quite sure what happened here. This bowl of mac and cheese isn't very good, but at the same time you can't bring yourself to tell that little stoat about how bad it is. You force yourself to take a few bites, but that's just about all you can manage.
 You probably won't be getting seconds.</p>

     <p>
      I think a ferret would make a pretty good bowl of mac and cheese. They use
      the boxed ones but they probably add a little bit more cheese into the mixture just to make it more flavorful and extra cheesy.

      Otters probably make a solid bowl of mac. Like, it's not going to be life
      changing or anything, but I think that if you just wanted a quick and good
      bowl of like Annie's mac and cheese, you would want an otter to make it.
      They get all the ingredient ratios and cook-time just right. It's a very
      nostalgic, simple and comforting bowl of mac.

      I think minks would make a really fancy mac and cheese. I don't know how to describe it really, but just know that if you get mac and cheese from a mink, it's going taste like it came from a 5-star restaurant.
